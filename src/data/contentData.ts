🔧 Type: Anti-Spam Zoom Ops Bot
🎖 Status: BETA | Internal Weapon
📍 Archive Location: Ops Files > File 002

💥 OPS BRIEFING
ZoomTurret Sniper is a real-time spam-killer bot for Zoom meetings.
It detects spam messages via keyword triggers, locates the message, and executes mouse-click macros to wipe them from the chat.
No dashboards. No manual reviews. Just precision kill-clicks.

This isn't some Zoom plugin — it's a pure custom-grade build.
The current version runs with hardcoded coordinates for the strike sequence.
Next version goes full dynamic: detects spam, locates target, and strikes — all by itself.

🎯 DELETE STRIKE SEQUENCE (LIVE VERSION)
1. Detect spam via trigger keywords
2. Hover to activate 3-dot menu
3. Click the 3-dot menu
4. Click "Delete" from dropdown
5. Confirm "Delete" in modal popup

All executed via pyautogui macros inside fullscreen Zoom (1920x1080).

🧠 INTENT + VISION
This bot was built out of need — during real spam floods in live Zoom sessions.
It's not for sale, not shared. Just proof.
If someone's under attack and needs this kind of weapon — I'll build theirs from scratch.

Future Upgrades:
- Dynamic sniper logic (no hardcoded coords)
- Discord version with full click-based message nuking
- Telegram flood defense
- Payload detector for PDF/token drops`

🧠 INTENT
This ain't a dashboard. It's a hidden gear stash — built for crypto tacticians, Telegram snipers, and founders who run silent.
FirePrint is my own drop zone — 1-click digital weapons. If someone stumbles on this file and needs fire of their own, I'm ready to forge it.

💥 DROPS INSIDE FIREPRINT

1. GHOSTDECK SYSTEMS
Private systems deck — built from scratch for solo founders. No branding. No fluff. Just pure ops.

2. NOMOD STEALTH SUITE
Zero-noise deployment. Pages that mask intent, collect signals, leave no trace.

3. DROP COMPOSER X
Not just posts — influence triggers. AI-crafted cold DMs, replies, bios, tweets. Street to stealth tone-switch built in.

4. DEGEN AI ASSISTANT
Telegram-native operator that adapts to your tone and drops. Fires like a ghost built for your grind.

5. BURNER FORM LINK
No-login stealth forms. Ghost capture with zero trail.

6. GHOST LEAD BEACON
No funnel. Just pure inbound traps that work from your Telegram bio or solo landers.

...and more waiting in the vault.`
